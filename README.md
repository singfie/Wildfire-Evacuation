This is an algorithm that allows the optimal selection of vessels for evacuations of islands that are affected by wildfire scenarios. This algorithm is a mixed-integer two-stage stochastic program, solved through a cutting plane algorithm.
This is an ongoing project and currently only the deterministic part of the model is implemented. Work in progress is ongoing throughout the coming weeks.

Next steps include the implementation of a stochastic model and demand generation functions.
